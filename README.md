# Porting of Tensorflow lite for microcontrollers on Renesas evaluation kit.

The following repository provides the code used to port [Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) on to Renesas RA family board, specifically the [EK-RA6M4](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/ra-cortex-m-mcus/ek-ra6m4-evaluation-kit-ra6m4-mcu-group) board. 

The code executes the Hello World project and outputs the results through UART onto a serial monitor using TFLM reference kernels.
